*** Fundamentals: ***

1. Classes:
    a.  Contrast this() and this. - this() is calling a different constructor with different parameters. 
        This references the attributes of the class in the class.
    b.  method overloading - same name method with different parameters (Not necessarily different number)
    c.  varargs - public String formatWithVarArgs(String... values) 
    d.  LVTI - Local Variable Type Inference (var ai = new ArrayList<Integer>();) Local variable type inference is a feature 
        in Java 10 that allows the developer to skip the type declaration associated with local variables (those defined 
        inside method definitions, initialization blocks, for-loops, and other blocks like if-else), and the type is inferred 
        by the JDK. It will, then, be the job of the compiler to figure out the datatype of the variable.
2. Encapsulation - Java Encapsulation is a way of hiding the implementation details of a class from outside access and only 
    exposing a public interface that can be used to interact with the class. (Setters and getters) 
3. Interfaces - Like a class, an interface can have methods and variables, but the methods declared in an interface are by 
    default abstract (i.e.) they only contain method signature and not the body of the method
4. Inheritance
    a. Overriding and polymorphism
    b. Contrast super() and super.
5. Exceptions (checked and unchecked)
6. Enums
7. Arrays
8. Use of Java Core API (String, StringBuilder, List/ArrayList, Date API)

*** Advanced: ***

9. Call-by-value and defensive copying
10. Private, default and static interface methods
11. Records
12. a custom immutable type
13. lambdas (Predicate)
14. Discussion of ‘final’ or ‘effectively final’
15. Method references
16. Switch expressions and ✔️ pattern matching
17. Sealed classes and interfaces

*** Extra marks: ***

18. Any topics from Java 22 and/or 23 - be sure to clearly explain these topics and what you had to do to get the newer 
    code to compile/run
19. Consistent updates to a public repository
